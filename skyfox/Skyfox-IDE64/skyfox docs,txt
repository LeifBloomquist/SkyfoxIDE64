The first 7 scenarios are training
missions with tanks only,some with
enemy planes, or some with both.

can destroy your base.

In the 8 invasions you must protect
your computer and whatever fighters
you have left.

turn the plane.press the spacebar to
engage in afterburners for quick
thrust,release it to return to pre

**hint**if you plug a second joystick
into port 2,you can use the fire button
on #2 for quick thrust.

between 1000 and 10,000 feet.  You must
fly through it each time you switch
between ground and air combat.  Flying
up to 30,000 feet results in heavy
